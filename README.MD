Developed out of necessity on a low-spec machine, this Ubuntu Task Manager is a lifesaver for when IntelliJâ€”or any applicationâ€”decides to crash without properly exiting. No more restarting the whole PC or digging through processes manually. It's a simple, terminal-based solution for efficiently managing and killing unresponsive tasks. Perfect for anyone seeking to streamline their workflow and keep their focus on coding, not on closing stubborn programs.
